# Green-Dorms-App
Green Dorms is an eco-friendly hostel that combines sustainable practices with dormitory-style hospitality. Our mission is to provide an affordable, comfortable stay while helping the Earth. To streamline the booking process, reduce environmental impact, and enhance guest experience, we are developing a mobile app for remote check-in/checkout and room service. This app will allow guests to book rooms, check in, order room service, and check out with minimal contact, ensuring a safer and more efficient stay. Our proposed system will replace the current manual, paper-based process with an automated, user-friendly digital solution, improving data maintenance, security, and overall operational efficiency.
